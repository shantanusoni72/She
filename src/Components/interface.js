The alarm is very loud, which gives me confidence when Im by myself without my partner. Its easy to use and has excellent craftsmanship. However, I did notice that the light isn‚Äôt very bright, and the alarm might not be as effective in louder environments like near a car playing loud music. Despite this, I believe its a valuable tool for added security and peace of mind, and I plan to buy more for my friends and family.',

This would alarm anyone intruding in on your personal space and provide that warn to an intruder to stay away. My birdie stays in my hand bag I love the variety of colours. I chose the colour purple, there are also many other colours you can choose from. Money well spent and will buy again for family to keep themselves safe.
